# R functions for computing the MMRM and IMMRM estimators for longitudinal randomized clinical trials

IMMRM.R and MMRM-II.R contains R functions to run IMMRM and MMRM-II, two variants of mixed model for repeated measures defined in Wang and Du (2023), to analyze longitudinal randomized clinical trials.
